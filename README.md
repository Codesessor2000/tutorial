This was a project for practise of React library.

I have tried a few mini projects so far :

1. Restaurant Menu Project
2. Hooks concepts( UseState, UseEffect, UseReducer Hooks Covered)
3. Todo List
4. Weather Application

Learnings: React is an awesome library for building complex UIs by dividing them into components.
